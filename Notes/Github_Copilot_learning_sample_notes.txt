Node.js: Build a simple REST API. This could be a backend service for a blog, where you can create, read, update, and delete blog posts. You can use Express.js, a popular web application framework for Node.js, to handle HTTP requests. You can also use a database like MongoDB or PostgreSQL to store your data.

React.js: Build a blog frontend. This application would consume the REST API you built with Node.js. You can create a user interface to display blog posts, and forms to create and edit posts. You can use the fetch API or a library like axios to make HTTP requests to your backend.

Angular.js: Build a task manager. This could be a simple application where you can create, update, and delete tasks. This will give you a good understanding of Angular.js concepts like modules, components, and services. You can also connect this to your Node.js backend and store tasks in the same database as your blog posts.

1. Node JS app step breakdown:

Set up your project: Initialize a new Node.js project by running npm init in your terminal. This will create a new package.json file in your project directory.

Install Express.js: Install Express.js, a web application framework for Node.js, by running npm install express in your terminal.

Create your server: Create a new file (e.g., server.js) and set up a basic Express.js server. This server should listen on a port for incoming requests.

Define your data model: Decide what data your blog posts will contain. For example, a blog post might have a title, content, author, and date.

Set up your database: Choose a database to store your blog posts. You could use a NoSQL database like MongoDB or a SQL database like PostgreSQL. Install the appropriate Node.js driver for your database.

Create routes: Define routes for creating, reading, updating, and deleting blog posts. Each route should correspond to a different endpoint of your API (e.g., GET /posts, POST /posts, PUT /posts/:id, DELETE /posts/:id).

Implement route handlers: For each route, write a function that handles requests to that route. This function should interact with your database to perform the appropriate operation (e.g., creating a new blog post, retrieving all blog posts, updating a specific blog post, deleting a specific blog post).

Test your API: Use a tool like Postman or curl to send requests to your API and check that it responds as expected.

Where to have nodejs server up and running: 

Heroku: Heroku is a cloud platform that lets you build, deliver, monitor, and scale apps. It's very beginner-friendly and has a free tier that's perfect for small projects. You can deploy Node.js applications directly from your GitHub repository.

Glitch: Glitch is a friendly community where you'll build the app of your dreams. It's a simple tool for creating web apps, that can be used to build and deploy Node.js applications for free.

Vercel: Vercel is a cloud platform for static sites and Serverless Functions. It's built to integrate with your favorite headless CMS, eCommerce, authentication, and more. Vercel offers a free tier and integrates well with GitHub.

AWS (Amazon Web Services): AWS offers a wide range of cloud services. For Node.js applications, you might use AWS Elastic Beanstalk, which is a fully managed service that makes it easy to deploy and run applications in several languages. AWS has a free tier, but it can be more complex to set up than the other options.

2. React JS app step breakdown:

Set up your project: Create a new React.js project using Create React App by running npx create-react-app blog-frontend in your terminal.

Understand your data: Identify the data your frontend will need from your backend. This will likely be the data for your blog posts.

Install necessary libraries: You might need to install additional libraries like axios for making HTTP requests, and react-router-dom for routing in your React application.

Create components: Start creating React components for each part of your UI. You might have a PostList component for displaying all posts, a Post component for displaying a single post, and a PostForm component for creating and editing posts.

Fetch data from your API: Use the fetch API or axios to get data from your backend. You might fetch all posts when the PostList component mounts, fetch a single post when the Post component mounts, and create or update a post when the PostForm is submitted.

Pass data to components: Pass the fetched data down to your components via props.

Handle user interaction: Implement event handlers to handle user interaction, like clicking a button to create a new post or edit an existing one.

Style your components: Use CSS to style your components. You can write regular CSS files, or use a CSS-in-JS solution like styled-components.

Test your components: Write tests for your components to make sure they behave as expected. You can use testing libraries like Jest and React Testing Library.

3. Angular JS app step breakdown:

Set up your project: Create a new AngularJS project. You can use a boilerplate or a seed project from GitHub to get started quickly.

Understand your data: Identify the data your application will need. In this case, it will be the tasks that the user creates.

Create your AngularJS modules: AngularJS uses modules to organize your code. You might have a main application module, and separate modules for different features.

Create your AngularJS controllers: Controllers in AngularJS are responsible for setting initial state and augmenting $scope with methods to control behavior. You might have a TaskListController for displaying all tasks, and a TaskController for creating and editing tasks.

Create your AngularJS services: Services in AngularJS are reusable business logic independent of views. You might have a TaskService that handles communication with your backend (if you decide to connect it to your Node.js backend).

Create your AngularJS directives: Directives in AngularJS are a way to create reusable components. You might create directives for your task list and task form.

Create your views: Views in AngularJS are the HTML templates that get compiled to display the rendered page. You'll need views for displaying all tasks and for creating/editing a task.

Handle user interaction: Implement event handlers to handle user interaction, like clicking a button to create a new task or edit an existing one.

Style your application: Use CSS to style your application. AngularJS allows you to scope CSS to specific components, which can make styling easier.

Test your application: Write tests for your controllers, services, and directives to make sure they behave as expected. You can use testing tools like Jasmine and Karma.
